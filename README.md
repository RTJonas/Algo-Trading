Hey. It's a lot of work, but very rewarding. We started by having a hackathon weekend and creating a SMA trading strategy for trading 
Ethereum on Bitfinex. It let us learn fast, on a high level, about the world of algorithmic trading before we got really serious about it.
So, maybe a quick task for you could be:

Find an exchange that you want to trade on, make an account.

Familiarize yourself with it's API (search github, etc)

Pick an asset, download it's historical data. Learn to play with the data. Describe it, plot it, know it.

Use the "hello world" indicator SMA and create a strategy with it. backtest it.

Instead of backtesting, use the exchange API to execute trades based on real time data (trades or bars)

Stand back and be amazed at how much you've learned and how little you know.
